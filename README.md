# Intro

A collection of my personal dot-files plus an initialization script

## TODO

Vim plugins
Arch install
i3 install

## What it does now

Installs tmux, zsh, and vim along with linking basic dot files.

Should work on osx and linux

## Bugs

assumes dot-files is cloned into homedir
oh-my-zsh install is not exactly idempotent
 need to delete .oh-my-zsh dir
